# Hi there, I'm Daniel! <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="25px">

I'm a Java developer living in Germany, I am programming with Java since beginning of 2019 and I like programming for networks.

I'm a Minecraft security developer and keep several of the biggest German networks running.
I am currently working stricly on new technologies in the minecraft security world to fight exploits and crashes more and more securely while keeping performance unaffected.
